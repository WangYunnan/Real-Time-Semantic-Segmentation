# Real_Time_Semantic_Segmentation
The code for paper "Distilling the Long-Range Knowledge for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation".

Environment: Ubuntu 18.04; Anaconda 5.2.0; pytorch 1.1.0; PyQt5; OpenCV 3.4.9.

The code will be available after the paper is received. 

In order to provide experimental results, I uploaded checkpoints for you to check.

Furthermore, to facilitate the demonstration, I also have uploaded the complete UI code, which you can run under windows or Linux. In this paper, we run this code on an embedded platform, NVIDIA Jetson Xavier.
